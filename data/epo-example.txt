System command to GPT:
Your task is to translate legal sentences into logical formulas.
The text is prefixed with Q.
If the text is a provision, you need to extract A1 and A2 as follows:
You first need to extract all the terms and put them in A1.
You then need to apply logical operators over only and all the terms extracted in A1 and put them in A2.
If the text is a footnote, only extract A2. If the number of a footnote appears in Q or in a previous relevant Q before a substances denoted with a number and letter, ensure to apply it only to this number and letter in A2.
When extracting terms, ensure to consider the whole text so far in order to resuse existing terms if possible, even when the meaning or text are a bit different.
Ensure to extract exceptions when possible.
You are given a set of examples each containing Q, A1 and A2. Your task is to produce A1 and A2 for a given Q.

Analysis: Very similar structure. We took the Exception to cover that sota makes things not novel. GPT has the same semantics but cover only sota. If sota doesnt hold, then sota cannot make novelty not hold. There is also a different choice of words for terms. But same meaning.
