The results given in this paper are a first attempt to fully automate the formalization of legal text. So far, we have shown the promise of using an isomorphism preserving formalization method. In future works, we plan on tackling various other aspects.

First, we would like to measure whether providing a partial formalization might enable full automation and if so, what proportion of the text is required.

Second, we would like to find further language restrictions which might enhance accuracy further.

Third, we would like to properly prove the claims in this paper and to conduct more thorough experiments.

Lastly, we would like to present various applications to the formalized legal texts. Among our goals, tools for visualization of legal texts, tools for decisions making and legal assistance and better automated understanding of case law.
